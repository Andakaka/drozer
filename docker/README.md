# Build and Install

If you want to build this container yourself, use the `docker build` command to build the Docker container:

`docker build -t <pending> .`

Alternatively, use the pre-built Docker container at <pending>:

`<pending>`

# Run and Connect

First, obtain a shell into the container:

`docker run -it <pending>`

Then run the Drozer command to connect to the phone:

`drozer console connect --server <phone IP address>`
